# Sorting (COMP 2000 - Data Structures)

What it can do:
- Runs through most of the ways to sort a slice

How to build yourself:
- Install [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/) or ```brew install go```
- get the repo ```go get github.com/knighthawkbro/sorting```
- cd to repo ```cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/knighthawkbro/sorting```
- run ```go build sort.go```
- run ```.\sort.go```
- conversly you can just run ```go run sort.go``` for an instant execution of the program
- I think you may need to set your [$GOPATH](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH) and create a src folder within for go build to work
